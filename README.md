# Xanadu Quantum Codebook

The Xanadu Quantum Codebook is an experimental, exercise-based introduction to
quantum computing using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai). This repository
contains all the source text and coding challenge templates in the Codebook;
the Codebook itself is available at [codebook.xanadu.ai](https://codebook.xanadu.ai).

## Providing feedback and getting help

The Codebook is currently in the **beta** stage of development. If you find an
