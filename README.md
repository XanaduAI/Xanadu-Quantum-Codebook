# Xanadu Quantum Codebook Test

The Xanadu Quantum Codebook is an experimental, exercise-based introduction to
quantum computing using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai). This repository
contains all the source text and coding challenge templates in the Codebook;
the Codebook itself is available at [codebook.xanadu.ai](https://codebook.xanadu.ai).

## Providing feedback and getting help

The Codebook is currently in the **beta** stage of development. If you find an
**error** in the Codebook, **something is not working as expected**, or have
other **technical feedback**, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/XanaduAI/Xanadu-Quantum-Codebook/issues/new/choose) in
