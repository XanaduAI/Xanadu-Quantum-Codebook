## What do I do if I get stuck?

If the provided hints aren't helpful, first refer to the content in the adjacent
(right) textbook panel. This companion content will provide a more
mathematical explanation of the concepts you learn through the exercises,
and may help you solve the problem.

If you get *really* stuck, you can post a message in the [PennyLane discussion
forum](https://discuss.pennylane.ai/) using the Codebook category. Please refer
explicitly to the codercise number (e.g., Codercise T.2).

If you think you've found an error in the contents or an issue with the autograder, please
report this on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/XanaduAI/Xanadu-Quantum-Codebook) by
creating a new issue. 

## Known issues

**Please read this section before proceeding.**

The Codebook is currently in **beta**, and as such, there are a few
limitations. These will be fixed in future versions of the website.

 - Currently, your progress is stored locally in your browser.  If you clear
   your browser cache, you will lose all your progress, and all content will
   return to its default state. (This is temporary, and eventually, a
   login system will be implemented)
 - Once you complete a challenge, it is not possible to go back and try a
   different solution, unless you clear your cache (but this will cause you
   to lose your progress).
