(c) Finally, write circuits which implement the evolution $e^{itX}$, starting in the $\vert 0 \rangle$ state, using the (i) the first-order approximation, (ii) the second-order approximation, and (iii) the full series via ``qml.RX``. The functions ``exp_U_first`` and ``exp_U_second`` from the previous two exercises are available.

Hitting the submit button will plot the normalized coefficient of $\vert 0\rangle$ for the main register qubit. The first-order results are red, second-order blue and full series is green. Do the results make sense?
