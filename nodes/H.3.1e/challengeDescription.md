The real and imaginary parts are varying sinusoidally, and out of phase. This suggests that $\langle \psi(t)\vert 0\rangle = e^{i\theta t}$ is simply rotating around the unit circle in the complex plane, for some parameter $\theta$. In other words, the amplitude for $\vert 0\rangle$ simply picks up a *phase* as time evolves.

(e) Finally, write a circuit (using the $Z$ rotation) which evolves an electron starting in state $\vert +\rangle$. From the plots of $\langle X\rangle$ and $\langle Y\rangle$, what do you think is happening?
