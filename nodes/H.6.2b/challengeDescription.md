(b) Write a circuit to apply

$$
X \otimes X + Z \otimes Z + X \otimes Z + Z \otimes X = U_0 + U_1 + U_2 + U_3
$$

to the $\vert 01\rangle$ state on the ``main`` register. You can access the auxiliary wires
as ``aux``. Note that 

$$
U_0 + U_1 + U_2 + U_3 \propto H \otimes H.
$$

Are the results what you expect?
