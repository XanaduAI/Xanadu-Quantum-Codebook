When you solve a codercise correctly, the progress bar at the bottom will update
to let you know how far along you are. After solving all codercises within the
node, the current node will turn green in the graph.

If you get stuck and want to start over, clicking the "Reset" button will reset
the code cell to its initial state. **Please note that in the current version of
the Codebook, once a challenge has been solved, it is not possible to go back and
modify your solution.**

For the most part, coding challenges will consist of completing portions of a
predefined function. Everything can be done using only standard Python,
and two special libraries:

 - NumPy, which is available as `np`
 - PennyLane (v0.19), which is available as `qml`

These two packages are imported into every code cell, and can be invoked as
above. The available NumPy version is that provided by PennyLane, which
contains some minor modifications; all functions can be called normally, though.
**Note that it is not possible to import any additional packages.**

Hints are provided for some problems in dropdown boxes, as shown below.
