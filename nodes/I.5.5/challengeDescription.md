*Solution*.

The depth of the original circuit is 8, and there are 13 combined $T$ and
$T^\dagger$ gates. The original $T$-depth is 6.

We can replace pairs of $T$ with $S$ (and pairs of $T\dagger$ with
$S^\dagger$). You can see this by multiplying out the matrix representation of
$T$, or just by considering that these are all special cases of $RZ$ rotations,
and the angles of the rotation combine additively. If ever there are four $T$,
we can replace this with an $Z$ (since two $S$ make a $Z$). Thus, we obtain the
circuit below:

The new depth is 6, the $T$-count is 3, and the $T$-depth is 2.
