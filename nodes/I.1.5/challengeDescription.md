You may not have realized it, but you now have all the ingredients to write a
very simple **quantum simulator** that can simulate the outcome of running
quantum algorithms on a single qubit! Let's put everything together.

***Codercise I.1.5.*** Use the functions below to simulate a quantum algorithm
   that does the following:
 1. Initialize a qubit in state $\vert 0\rangle$
 2. Apply the provided operation ``U``
 3. Simulate measuring the output state 100 times
 
You'll have to complete a function for initialization, but we've provided
functions for the other two.
