While it is much easier to specify a few numbers than a matrix, this description of
a unitary is still is not the most intuitive. For every unitary operation you
want to implement you would first have to compute its three parameters, which
would be tedious. Thankfully, many quantum algorithms are based on a small set
of known unitary matrices which we will call directly by name. In the next few sections,
we'll explore this family of single-qubit gates.
