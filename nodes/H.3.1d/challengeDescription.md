So, we've seen how to take something physical, turns its evolution into a mathematical expression, and then to do the same thing on a quantum computer!

(d) Hitting the submit button will plot the real and imaginary parts of $\langle\psi(t)\vert 0\rangle$ separately, where $\vert \psi(t)\rangle = e^{e^{i\alpha t Z}}\vert 0\rangle$. What do you think is happening to the state of the bar magnet as it evolves over time?
