*Solution*. Given that the common denominator is $\sqrt{2}^3$, we can infer that
3 Hadamards have been applied. Since Hadamard is its own inverse, there has to
be some number of $T$ in between them. Now consider the phases that are present
in the matrix elements. There is a phase of $i$, suggesting that there is a pair
of $T$ gates $TT = S$ somewhere. Then, the largest combined phase is $i
e^{i\pi/4}$, so we can figure that there are at most 3 $T$s total. If we know
that two of them have to be together to make an $S$, that means the remaining
one is flying solo.

There are thus just two combinations (expressed below in matrix multiplication order;
the circuits will contain the gates in the opposite order):

 - $HTHTTH$
 - $HTTHTH$
 
The second one is correct.
