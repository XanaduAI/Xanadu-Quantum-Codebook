***Codercise I.15.4.*** Put everything together: create a QNode
   that will execute your teleportation procedure, and return the quantum state!

   All three of the quantum functions you wrote in the previous exercises are
   available here to use: `state_preparation`, `entangle_qubits`, and
   `rotate_and_controls`. Feel free though to use your modified version of
   `state_preparation`, if you prefer.
