The ground state minimizes the energy. If the graph is bipartite, then we can "colour" the nodes with states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ so that any pair has distinct states on either end and the edge contributes $-1$ to the energy. Thus, the ground state energy will be $-4$ just in case the graph is bipartite, and higher otherwise.
