(b) For $n \in \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$, determine the optimal number of steps for Grover search. As usual, we choose a simple combination ``combo = [0, 0, ..., 0]`` since the optimal number of steps does not depend on it. Use the function ``local_max_arg(num_list)`` for finding the first local maximum in a list of numbers ``num_list``. The function ``grover_iter(combo, steps)`` is available from the previous exercises, and gives the probability for observing different computational basis states.
