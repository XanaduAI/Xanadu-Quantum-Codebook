Welcome to the Xanedu Quantum Codebook! This resource will help you learn quantum computing by using
Xanadu's quantum software framework PennyLane.

Please read both "panels" on this page before exploring the rest of the
Codebook. This panel contains interactive coding exercises for you to solve. The
panel adjacent on the right provides written content to help you solve them, and
to gain a more theoretical understanding of the concepts presented here.

## Codebook coding challenges

The core component of the Codebook is a set of coding challenges (codercises) in
Python. They require you to test your knowledge of new concepts by solving
short quantum computing problems. The challenges are autograded, and will give
you immediate feedback on the correctness of your work.

The first codercise in every node is unlocked, but in order to progress to the
next challenge within a node, you will need to solve the current challenge.

A codercise looks something like this. The places where you should
add your own code are clearly marked.
