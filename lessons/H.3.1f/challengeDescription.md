The plots of $\langle X\rangle$ and $\langle Y\rangle$ are oscillating and out of phase, just like the real and imaginary components of $\langle\psi(t)\vert 0\rangle$. This suggests that they too are components of a vector on a circle, but now this is the spin vector itself rather than a complex number. We picture this below:

In general, the spin vector will rotate around the $z$-axis in a motion called *Larmor precession*:
