The uniform superposition certainly includes the state $\vert
\mathbf{s}\rangle$, but it includes everything else as well! The
probability distribution tells us the chance of observing a particular
computational basis state when we measure the circuit. Our chances of
finding the solution using this circuit are therefore no better than a random
guess! We need to do something more.
