(b) Complete the code below to apply the sum $X + Z$ to the state $\vert 0\rangle$ (on the main register). You can invoke ``add_two_unitaries(U, V)`` from the last challenge, and access the matrix form of the Paulis using, e.g., ``qml.PauliX.matrix``.

Note that $X + Z \propto H$. Are the results what you expect?
